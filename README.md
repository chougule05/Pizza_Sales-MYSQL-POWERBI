5.	Average Pizza Per Order: The average number of pizzas sold per order, calculated by dividing the total number of pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
   
Charts Requirement
We would like to visualize various aspects of our pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. We have identified the following requirements for creating charts:
1.	Daily Trend for Total Orders: Create a bar chart that displays the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period. This chart will help us identity any patterns or fluctuations in order volumes on a daily basis.
2.	Monthly Trend for Total Orders: Create a line chart that illustrate the hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. This chart will allow us to identify peak hours or periods of high order activity.
3.	Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category: Create a pie chart that shows the distribution of sales across different pizza categories. This chart will provide insights into the popularity of various pizza categories and their contribution to overall sales.
4.	Percentages of Sales by Pizza Size: Generate a pie chart that represent the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sizes. This chart will help us understand customer preference for pizza sizes and their impact on sales.
5.	Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category: Create a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category. This chart will allow us to compare the sales performance of different pizza category
6.	Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quality and Total Orders: Create bar chart highlighting the top 5 best-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quality and total orders. This chart will help us identify the most popular pizza option.
7.	Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Revenue, Total Quality and Total Orders: Create bar chart highlighting the Bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas based on revenue, total quality and total orders. This chart will help us identify the underperforming of less popular pizza option.
